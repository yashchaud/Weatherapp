React Weather Application
This project is a simple weather application built using React. It allows users to search for the current weather of a city and toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.


Maincomponent: This is where most of the logic resides. It includes states for handling input (city), displaying weather data, and potential errors.
Images: Contains static images used within the application.
App.js: Wrapper component that renders the Maincomponent.
index.js: The entry point which renders the entire React app.
